install by npm install -g @angular/cli
check version by  ng --version

create first app > ng new app-name
or ng new my-ng-app --inline-style --inline-template >>> to learn step by step
choose options>  NO to SSR and ZONE.JS

GENERATE COMPONENTS 
ng g c name OR ng generate component name

TO GENERATE INSIDE A FOLDER
ng g c components/header

inside angular.json > following are removed >
 "inlineTemplate": true,
"inlineStyle": true,

original block : "schematics": {
        "@schematics/angular:component": {
          "inlineTemplate": true,
          "inlineStyle": true,
          "style": "scss"
        }
      },

REASON: it will create new components with HTML and scss versions too

***************ANGULAR DATA BINDING*************
binding data between the typescript class and the related component's inlineTemplate
we use signals


***************ROUTING*************
Angular is a single page app. but using routes we can make a multi page app that user can navigate
browser can only load the JS bundle that relate to the current loaded page (including parents)

to handle routes=> app.routes.ts 

to load the new component without reloading the entire page(works as a link) >> use 'routerlink'

*************** ANGULAR SERVICES *************
used to encapsulate data,making HTTP calls, or any task that is not directly related to rendering UIs

how to add>>> ng g service services/todos

making HTTP calls with angular services > to call external services >> 
 we need to add the provideHttpClient in app.config.ts Providers array

*************** ANGULAR DIRECTIVES *************
add additional behavious to elements(html elements,components, etc) in ng app
create > ng g directive name

*************** ANGULAR PIPES *************
transform data inside the template
built-in pipes: uppercase, currency, date, etc

we can create custom pipes
ng g pipe name










control flow blocks???
@for, @if, etc
