***************ANGULAR DATA BINDING*************
binding data between the typescript class and the related component's inlineTemplate
we use signals


***************ROUTING*************
Angular is a single page app. but using routes we can make a multi page app that user can navigate
browser can only load the JS bundle that relate to the current loaded page (including parents)

to handle routes=> app.routes.ts 

to load the new component without reloading the entire page(works as a link) >> use 'routerlink'

*************** ANGULAR SERVICES *************
used to encapsulate data,making HTTP calls, or any task that is not directly related to rendering UIs

how to add>>> ng g service services/todos
