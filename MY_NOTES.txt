***************ANGULAR DATA BINDING*************
binding data between the typescript class and the related component's inlineTemplate
we use signals


***************ROUTING*************
Angular is a single page app. but using routes we can make a multi page app that user can navigate
browser can only load the JS bundle that relate to the current loaded page (including parents)

to handle routes=> app.routes.ts
