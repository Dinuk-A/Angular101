################### for loops in NG ###################
instead of manually displaying all the items in an array, use a angular for loop
type '*' inside a div we need to start
works same as attributes > *ngFor=""
its called a directive, specially a STRUCTUAL DIRECTIVE = it changes the str of DOM 
remember to import > import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';  in app.ts 
and inside @Component >  imports: [CommonModule,RouterOutlet],

as of 2025, using ngFor is deprecated 
instead use @for 

if we commented the items in app.ts this will give an error (then its an array of 'never' objects)
